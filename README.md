## Project Overview 📝

This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset and build a classification model to predict passenger survival. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, class, and fare. The project uses different machine learning models to evaluate performance and provide insights.

### Key Objectives 🎯
- **Data exploration and preprocessing** 🕵️
- **Feature engineering** 🔧
- **Model training and evaluation** 🧠
- **Visualization of results** 📊

## Installation 🛠️

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data 📊

The project uses the Titanic dataset, which is available from [Kaggle's Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The dataset consists of:
- **train.csv** - Training data with survival outcomes.
- **test.csv** - Test data for making predictions.

### Key Features 🛳️
- `Pclass` (Passenger class)
- `Sex` (Gender)
- `Age` (Age in years)
- `SibSp` (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- `Parch` (Number of parents/children aboard)
- `Fare` (Ticket fare)
- `Embarked` (Port of embarkation)

## Modeling Process 🔍

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 📈
   - Visualize the distribution of features and relationships with survival.
2. **Data Preprocessing** 🛠️
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and scale features.
3. **Model Selection** 🧠
   - Train and compare models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
4. **Evaluation Metrics** 📊
   - Use accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.

## Results 🏆

The best model achieves a balanced combination of accuracy and generalization to unseen data. Key insights include:
- **Gender** played a significant role in survival, with women having a higher survival rate.
- **Passenger class** affected the likelihood of survival, where first-class passengers had a better chance of surviving.

**Visuals and plots** illustrating these insights are provided in the `notebooks/` and `results/` directories. 📉
